## Project 2

SenshiKing is a local multiplayer turn-based game with rock-paper-scissors mechanics, inspired by Mesuking and Mushiking: The King of Beetles.

The players can choose one from various fighters and use different power-ups during the battle. In addition, the players can perform all these actions by presenting and placing other markers in the arena field. The game environment mimics the day/night light and the weather conditions that dwell in real-life.

In the end, only the toughest luckier survives.

### Technologies
- Vuforia
- Unity
